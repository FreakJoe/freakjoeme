Hello, my name is FreakJoe. Well, it's more of a pseudonym, really, but I guess that's besides the point.
This website fulfills two central purposes:

* It provides an opportunity for me to **market my services**.
* At the same time it serves as a place for me to **share** things I believe other people with similar **interests** may be interested in.

Reading the above you may ask yourself what services I am marketing, exactly. Currently, my focus lies in programming **desktop applications** using **Python** or **Java**. Technologies I have used in the past include, but are not limited to:

* The **Flask** module to create small, personal websites using Python
* The **SQLAlchemy** module in combination with a wide variety of database types using Python
* The **Matplotlib** module to create graphs using Python
* Qt by means of the **PyQt** wrapper to create cross-platform graphical applications using Python
* **JavaFX** to create cross-platform Java-based graphical applications

Currently, I am most **interested in** the following technologies and areas of science:

* **Cryptocurrencies**, with a focus on Bitcoin
* **Finance** and **algorithmic trading**
* **Math**-heavy areas of computer science
* **Medicine** and **biology**

Please do not misunderstand. I am not an expert in any of the above areas. I have neither a strong mathematical, nor a strong financial or medical background. These are simply topics that I find fascinating and would enjoy working on in the future.
